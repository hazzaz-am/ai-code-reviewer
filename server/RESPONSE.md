❌ Bad Code:
```python
print('Hello, World!'); x = 5; y = 10; sum = x + y; print(sum);
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ Code is written on a single line, making it hard to read.
* ❌ No spacing between operators and operands reduces readability.
* ❌ Lack of comments makes the purpose of the code less clear.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```python
# Program to add two numbers and print their sum

# Initialize variables
x = 5
y = 10

# Calculate the sum
sum = x + y

# Print the greeting and the sum
print('Hello, World!')
print(sum)
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ Code is now multi-lined for better readability.
* ✔️ Added comments to explain the purpose of each section.
* ✔️ Included spacing around operators for enhanced clarity.
* ✔️ Grouped related operations together.

Final Note:

Improving code readability makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and maintain the code in the future.
Simple changes like adding comments and proper spacing can significantly enhance code quality.
